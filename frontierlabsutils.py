    Finds the typical gap between write times (usually ~185770 microseconds),
    typical_write_microsec
    
    Compares each write time to the expected write time. If the difference between
    write times is more than 10 microseconds, then a buffer overflow is assumed.
    These differences in write times are usually approximately multiples of 
    typical_write_microsec but sometimes are not. Unsure if these are true missing buffers.
    
    When a buffer is missing, calculates the sample index of the missing buffer and the
    number of samples that should be added at that index. These are estimated 
    based on the input sample_rate.
    
    An example which explains the buffer indexing and length logic: 
        ```
        true_write_time was 6 blocks
        expected_write_time was 3 blocks
        first_write_time was 1 block
        start_time was 0 blocks

        at first_write_time, inserted block from start_time to first_write_time
        at second_write_time, inserted blcok from first_write_time to second_write_time
        at third_write_time, missed a block that would have been inserted at 
            second_write_time to expected_write_time
        at fourth_write_time, missed a block
        at fifth_write_time, missed a block
        at sixth_write_time, inserted a block at the position of second_write_time. 
            these were the true samples from fifth_write_time to sixth_write_time.

        To correct this, we need to add:
        0s for second_write_time to expected_write_time (third_write_time)
        0s for third_write_time to fourth_write_time
        0s for fourth_write_time to fifth_write_time
